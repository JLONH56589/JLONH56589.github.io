		<p><strong>Languages/Technologies Used:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, Google Colab
		</p>

		<p>This project was a natural language processing project conducted by myself, Darren Lim, and 
			Jerson Villanueva for the CS 175: Project in Artificial Intelligence course at UCI.
			We conducted experiments to compare the accuracy of different neural network models and 
			word embedding techniques when used to process and predict the sentiment of text 
			movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative sentiment. Specifically, we experimented 
			with convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, regular neural networks with GloVe 
			word embeddings, one hot encoding, and word2vec word embeddings. In the initial stages of our 
			experiment, we rejected one hot encoding and word2vec due to their poor accuracy, and focused further 
			experimentation on CNN, RNN, and neural network with GloVe. 
		</p>

		<p>I personally worked on the integration of the movie review datasets into our Google Colab 
			environment. I also integrated the movie review data into the tokenization and vocabulary creation 
			sections of our data pipeline. I then coded the proper neural network layers and parameters for 
			the convolutional neural network and the recurrent neural network, as well as the code for 
			saving and reloading neural network models for use once training had completed. 
		</p>

		<p>Overall, this project went fairly smoothly despite the machine learning knowledge prerequisites 
			needed to implement our experiments. We took advantage of TensorFlow documentation that 
			provided guidance on how we could use it in regards to natural language processing. We then 
			easily incorporated the addition of various word embedding techniques into our data processing 
			to start conducting experiments. There was some trial and error when it came to setting the 
			correct parameters to process our data into the neural networks correctly. From there, 
			full-fledged experimentation became a little bit frustrating because we found that with 
			the default settings in Google Colab, it would potentially take around 3 hours to run 
			one neural network model once. Thankfully, we realized that Google Colab provides free GPU 
			acceleration, which reduced 3 hours to 20 minutes. 
		</p>
		<p>By the end of the project, we found that convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks 
			worked relatively well for classifying movie reviews, with about 80% accuracy for both. Meanwhile, 
			GloVe word embeddings on top of a regular neural network did not perform as well as the other models. 
			Furthermore, we found that models trained on one dataset did not have a satisfactory accuracy when 
			tested on samples from a different dataset, which may mean that the accuracy of our models depended 
			on the quality and size of the dataset it was trained on. If you're interested in reading more about 
			our results, feel free to look at our code linked at the top of this project page, as well as 
			the link to our Google Slides presentation summarizing our experimentation process and findings.
		</p>

		<p>
			This project personally felt very rewarding because our project group was able to independently 
			pick a topic that interested all of us (natural language processing), and I was able to 
			actually put the many months of learning the concepts behind machine learning from previous 
			courses into a practical experiment with valuable results. I also loved learning to use 
			TensorFlow and Google Colab, both machine learning tools that are very useful and that allowed 
			us to relatively easily implement the neural networks we needed.
