		<p><strong>Languages/Technologies Used:</strong> C#, Unity
		</p>

		<p>This project was a monitor game prototype created by myself and Shayla Luong. In under 4 days,
			we created a game where every 4 minutes, a lottery drawing begins where leaves fall across
			the screen into boxes at the bottom of the screen, resulting in a 6-number lottery draw.
			Colorado Lottery specifically requested the creation of monitor games, which are lottery games
			with no direct user input, and are meant to commence very frequently (for example, every 4 minutes)
			and are typically accompanied by paper slips for players to place bets.
		</p>

		<p>I personally worked on creating the Unity prefabs for the leaf and box objects, as well as writing
			the C# scripts to properly control the behaviors of the leaves, boxes, lottery timer, and lottery 
			draw generation in the background of the application. Writing the C# scripts also involved
			using Unity's unique coding paradigms to allow different objects to communicate properly with 
			the game controller object to coordinate the behavior of the lottery draws.
		</p>

		<p>Although my coding partner Shayla and I had not been very familiar with Unity when we started
			this project, we ended up having a lot of fun learning to use Unity and coding in C# to 
			make our concept come to life. Given that the project was a game, there was a lot of room for 
			creativity, and we greatly enjoyed taking advantage of unique Unity features such as particle 
			systems to put our game together. 
		</p>
		<p>Shayla and I had previously worked on other projects where we created games, but this particular 
			project presented a unique challenge because the Colorado Lottery Game Jam organizers requested 
			monitor games, which must have no direct user input and instead depend on external betting slips 
			to allow patrons to place bets on the outcome of whatever game we created. Also, the game would 
			commence very frequently (for example, every 4 minutes), so creating a game that was engaging, 
			interesting, but still completed fast enough for the required frequency was important. We met this 
			requirement by first generating the final draw behind the scenes, then generating a list of leaves 
			to be generated that would allow the game to finish in time.
