				<h3>Back-end Dev</h3>
				<p>The backbone of my programming expertise gained from my time at UC Irvine. I know
					many popular languages like Python, Java, and C++, as well as technologies like

				<h3>Front-end Dev</h3>
				<p>Front-end development? You're looking right at it! I coded this personal website
					myself. Although my programming coursework focused more on back-end, 
					I've delved into front-end on my own and it's been quite fun. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
				<p>This is a personal interest of mine! While pursing my Computer Science degree at 
					UCI, I specialized in machine learning and AI.
					In particular, I have worked with natural language processing (NLP).

		<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">I'm very interesting</p>

		<div class="about-me__body">
			<p>I recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2020 with a 
				Bachelor's in Computer Science, specializing in machine learning and artificial 
				intelligence, a personal interest of mine. I've learned a lot in the classroom, 
				but I've also worked on projects at hackathons where I collaborated with my friends.
				Visit the <a href="#projects">Projects section of this page</a> to see some of my favorite projects 
				I've worked on in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have experiences using languages like Python, Java, C++, C#, MySQL, 
					HTML, and CSS, as well as technologies and tools like TensorFlow, 
					Unity, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. Outside of technical 
					ability, I also have great teamwork and communication skills gained from my 
					experience in hackathon groups, my time working at the front desk of 
					Arroyo Vista student housing, and my two years of 
					experience as a board member for the KKAP dance team.
			</p>

			<p>In my free time, I love to dance! There might be a stereotype of CS majors always 
				staying inside, but I was very involved in the UCI dance community. I was part 
				of a dance team called 
				<a href="https://youtu.be/MFviBKYQkys?t=232" target="_blank">Urban Motus</a>, 
				focusing on hip-hop and modern dance styles. 
				As previously mentioned, 
				I also served as a board member for another dance team called KKAP for two years, 
				where I worked in a team of 10 student leaders to organize weekly dance workshops, 
				dance practices, and social events for over 100 members.
